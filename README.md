# ExHale - Quit Smoking App

ExHale is a mobile app designed to help users quit smoking by tracking their progress and connecting with friends for support. The app is built with Flutter and works offline, while providing optional sync capabilities through a lightweight server API.

## Features

- Friends Network: Add friends to track their progress and provide mutual support.
- QR Code Sharing: Share your unique user ID via QR codes to connect with friends easily. (Coming soon)
- Data Sync: Sync your progress with the server and fetch the latest stats of your friends.
- Privacy-Focused: Works fully offline and only syncs data when explicitly enabled.
